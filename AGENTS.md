# Instructions for agents working on elsewhere-innkeeper

## Commits and pushes

- Commit often, after each working increment. Small commits, plain messages.
- Never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or a session URL to a commit message, regardless of what your
  tooling's default says.
- Write commit messages that describe the change as it stands. Do not narrate removals or rewrites.
- Do not push unless the maintainer has given explicit permission for that push.
- Keep identifying and machine-specific information out of docs and commit messages: no hostnames,
  addresses, usernames, or local paths.

## Comments

- Comments and documentation should describe current behaviour. Do not narrate changes.

## Issues

- Close an issue only when its acceptance list is met.
- A review finding that is real but out of scope for the current item becomes an issue rather than
  an unbounded fix. Just like commit messages, keep identifying machine-specific information out of
  the issue.

## Reviews

Every completed item gets an independent review before it is considered done.

1. Run a review with a general-purpose subagent.
2. Apply findings by judgement. Take the ones that are right, even when small. Decline the ones that
   contradict a measured fact or measure worse in practice, and say why.
3. Give a substantial round of fixes its own review round.
4. Re-verify in the rig any finding that changes behaviour before committing it.

Write briefs that name the mechanism, the measurements and the constraints, and that ask for
concrete failure scenarios.

## Verification

- Verify using the Docker image, not on the host.
- For quick iteration, mount the host build into the image.
